# UTM Builder   

Program developed for workplace. Internal links require the use of UTMs to segment and track traffic activity through Google Analytics, Looker Studio, or some other pixel..


## Optimizations

In this fork project, an improvement was made to discard empty queries, thus cleaning up the URL, especially for internal links, since they do not require utm_source.
