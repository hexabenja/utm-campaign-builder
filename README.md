# UTM Builder   

Program developed for workplace. Internal links require the use of UTMs to segment and track traffic activity through Google Analytics, Looker Studio, or some other pixel..


## Optimizaciones

In this fork project, an improvement was made to discard empty queries, thus cleaning up the URL, especially for internal links, since they do not require utm_source.


## CÃ³mo ejecutar?

Execute the .py file using Python's Compiler or use another terminal like Online Compiler for Python

The program is compatible with .exe converting the .py file to .exe using PyInstaller library
